ArrowAlert is a HTML5 based mobile application that uses phonegap/cordova for native hooks.
The app uses an MVC design powered by angularjs, and a REST api to obtain data.

CODE:
	www/controllers/controllers.js 	- The controller logic
	www/js/index.html				- The notification hooks/initialization
	www/index.html					- The layout html
	www/views/						- Partial html views
	www/models/						- The models (utilize REST via restangular)
	www/js/input.js					- The input bindings
